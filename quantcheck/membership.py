"""Membership billing-window arithmetic.

Billing windows are anchored to the 9th of every month at 00:00:00 in
America/New_York: ``[9th 00:00, next 9th 00:00)``. This is equivalent to the
plain-language framing used when this was specified: "9th 00:00 through the
8th 24:00".

Design notes (read before touching this file, it is the foundation the whole
membership system sits on):

- The anchor day (``ANCHOR_DAY = 9``) exists in every month of the year, so
  month arithmetic on anchor-aligned datetimes never has to clamp a day that
  does not exist in the target month (unlike, say, a day-31 anchor bumping
  into February). ``extend_expiry`` still clamps when it operates on a
  manually-edited expiry that is not anchor-aligned (see
  ``_add_calendar_months``); that path is defensive, not something anchor
  arithmetic itself relies on.
- Every public function requires timezone-aware input and internally
  normalizes to ``MEMBERSHIP_TZ``. Naive datetimes are rejected outright
  because silently assuming a timezone is exactly the kind of ambiguity that
  produces off-by-one-day member cutoffs.
- All comparisons in this module (``is_active``, and the ``<`` checks inside
  ``next_anchor``/``window_of``) are safe across DST transitions even though
  Python's aware-datetime comparison takes a "compare naive wall-clock
  tuples" shortcut when both operands share the identical ``tzinfo`` object
  (which they always do here, since ``zoneinfo.ZoneInfo`` caches by key and
  every datetime in this module is built with the same ``MEMBERSHIP_TZ``
  instance). That shortcut only produces a wrong chronological verdict when
  two datetimes share the exact same wall-clock hour/minute/second but
  differ in ``fold`` (the repeated hour during a "fall back" transition).
  America/New_York's DST transitions always happen between 01:00 and 03:00
  local time, and every datetime this module produces is pinned to
  00:00:00, so that ambiguous window is never hit. See
  ``tests/test_membership.py::DstTests`` for tests that pin this down.
